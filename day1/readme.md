### Steps taken

1) Figure out how to extract the data from a text file
Firstly, I copy and and pasted the data into `day1.txt`. Then I installed typescript globally. To create a new typescript file along with the config, I ran the following command `tsc --init`. I also `npm install @types/node` so that I can import fs. fs will allow me to read the file.
